# Summary

* During our experiments, we found 75 new solutions (previously unknown) whose
  objective value match that of the currently best known solution.

* We managed to find 8 instances improving the best known solution of TSPTW  
  instances in two datasets using our DD-LNS method. Our CP model is also
  highly efficient as it managed to improve the best known solution of 10 
  TSPTW instances in one benchmark suit.

* We found out that the currently best known solution of one instance is 
  actually infeasible for the TSPTW, and we propose a new solution whose 
  objective score is somewhat close tho that of the infeasible solution 
  (957 vs 917).
