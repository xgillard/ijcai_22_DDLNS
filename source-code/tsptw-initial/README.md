# TSPTW initial

This project implements (my take on) Da Silva and Urrutia (2010) algorithm
which is apparently the state-of-the art method to finding an initial feasible
solution for the TSPTW.

The relevant papers to understanding this bit of code are the following:

- A General Variable Neighborhood Search Heuristic for the Traveling Salesman
  Problem with Time Windows under Complete Time Minimization.
  Amghar, Cordeau, Gendron -- INFORMS, 2019

- A General VNS Heuristic for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows.
  Da Silva, Urrutia -- Discrete Optimization, 2010
